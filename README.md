# Spring Hospital API

This project aims to enhance my knowledge of the Spring Boot Framework. 
The goal was to create a REST API for managing CRUD operations for Patients, Employees (including Medics and Receptionists), and scheduling Appointments. The API does not perform DELETE requests.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/arthurspedine/spring-hospital-api.git
```

Create a Database named `hospital_api` and setup your MySQL credencials in `application.properties`

The program was developed to always create a ADMIN user with the credencials:
```bash
   login: admin
   password: 123
```

### Checkout the Swagger Documentation to understand how the requests work and try your self the API locally
